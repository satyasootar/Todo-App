I created an app that functions like a todo list using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The app allows me to add and delete tasks as completed. I can also sync my tasks across different devices using Firebase's real-time database. The app has a simple and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. I learned a lot about web development and Firebase by working on this project.
